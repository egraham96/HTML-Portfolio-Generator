# HTML Portfolio Generator

## Description:
This week's homework required us to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the NPM Inquirer package. The application will be invoked by using the node index.js in the user's command line. 

## Installation Instructions:
Download this repository. Install the inquirer and FS node modules (For example, "npm install inquirer"). Run the file by typing "node index" into your terminal.

## Built With:
* Javascript
* [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Inquirer NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package//inquirer)
* [FS NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs)
